      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, My name is Daniel. For all 16 years of my life, I've lived in Oklahoma with a passion for figuring out how things work.</p>
        <p>Around the time I turned 6, I learned about these things called computers that could show practically anything I wanted to know.</p>
        <p>Being a curious 6-year-old, I thought that was really cool and I wanted to know how this worked, but of course I didn't understand what code was back then and I wouldn't know for several years.</p>
        <p>When I was about 12 years old, I learned about this cool thing called HTML that would let me make websites. I began taking classes learning of the existence of programming languages like Python, C, and Java.</p>
        <p>When 2020 hit, my knowledge of how to code grew exponentially and this was the first time I tried actually making a website.</p>
        <p>It was pretty terrible, but in the 4 years since, I've learned a lot about crucial web design elements</p>
